Bubbledomes are our version of future real estate that we foresee humanity sheltering in when the world begins to end. 
Cities over the course of humanity have risen and fallen and entire civilisations have collapsed before, and usually there is an element of climate change that causes this. 
We talked about this internally more as a meme, but the reality when we actually decided to dig in a bit more is quite alarming, sinister, and so ludicrous that it becomes reality.

[Here's a cool little slide deck from Forbes on the subject too](https://www.forbes.com/stories/billionaires/inside-billionaire-bunkers/)

Basically theres big business in creating end of the world doomsday bunkers. We want to reach more than just 50-100 billionaires driving daddy's lambo around the cool streets of LA. We want to reach all of humanity and build areas where art, technology and life can continue to prosper, because what the hell else will we do when we can't buy crypto punks anymore? 

Endcoin will eventually position itself to create a REIT in charge of buying land and developing bubbledomes for humanity's inevitable end should we not heed scientific warnings of climate change.
