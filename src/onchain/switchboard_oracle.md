# Switchboard
As part of recent work, we ended up discovering Switchboard, who have a really great community, and a fairly cheap oracle system, allowing us to check our data against those other sources we mentioned earlier. 

We use switchboard to aggregate all of the data together and get a average SST value of the earth. 
We do this once a day, and this value becomes instrumental in the emission function of our AMM.
