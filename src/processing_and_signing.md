# Processing and Signing
In the processing and signing stage, we are effectively encrypting and verifying data at each individual step, outputting a [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) which can be interrogated to establish the data integrity. 
With accurate device position, time data, and satellite positional data, we can improve our confidence that our device recorded data from the right source. This data is added to the overall signed data collection. 

We decode audio file and sign all of the output.
