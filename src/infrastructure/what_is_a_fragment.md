# What is a fragment?
In this context, a fragment is a square of usable information that can be cross checked with other squares to provide consensus of data accuracy. 


We gather data from a satellite, we re-project the image onto the earth to get accurate latitude and longitude values, we then randomly offset the grid to create fragments. This means if me and my neighbor both have satellite receivers, and collect the same image, we will both have a slightly different collection of fragments. We'll discuss this further shortly. 


We are currently defining a fragment as a 0.25 degree square of latitude and longitude values, which covers around 40km of earths surface, but this is subject to change after more R&D cycles.
