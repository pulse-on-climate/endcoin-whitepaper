# Transmission
There are two common transmission types: 
- HRPT (High Resolution Picture Transmission): HRPT is transmitting in L-band (1670-1710 MHz) range and can provide the resolution of 1km per pixel.
- APT (Automatic Picture Transmission): APT is transmitting in VHF (137-138 MHz) range and can provide the lower resolution of 4km per pixel.

A lot of our tests up to now have focused on APT data, its a bit easier to consume, but HRPT is definitely the future and where we want to get to for more accurate temperature values.
