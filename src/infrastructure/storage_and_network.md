# Storage and Network

## Storage
This is an area we have experience in from previous work, but we're still unsure on how exactly we will approach this for Endcoin. 
We have written apps to interface with IPFS - but because we have a proof of all data, we could potentially just dump it all in an S3 bucket for the next step. 

Ultimately this step is fairly low risk due to the steps taken on proofs and data verification throughout the process, so we will likely be driven by cost and ease of access in this section. If you have suggestions, please let us know. 

## Network
We aim to have a flexible approach to networking and are fairly confident on our data integrity due to signing, so enabling our device to communicate over WiFi, Ethernet (With cool POE support) or 5G will be our focus. We have expressed an interest in working with the folks at Helium to be able to agnostically use their infrastructure and the noises they've made so far are really positive.
