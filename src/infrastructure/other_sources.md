There is a plethora of data products, sensor networks etc. that already exist, but are owned by centralized entities. 

We believe any centralized system can be swayed by opinion and personal gain, and we find this problematic in the context of climate science data. 

We aim to be another voice in that room, to help bolster scientific endeavors and validate the hard work of so many brilliant minds in climate science and technology.

We have recently been following the work of [Creative Commons Open Climate Data project from spring 2023.](https://creativecommons.org/about/open-climate-data/)

This is a brilliant cause and provides a framework for insitutions to open up their climate data to be accessable by all.
